-- STEP 1: Check your current user and admin status
-- Run this query first to see your current status
SELECT

-- Only run this if the above query shows is_admin = false
UPDATE public.user_profiles

    is_admin = true,

-- STEP 3: Verify the quantities table exists and you can access it
-- This should return the count of quantity groups
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_quantity_groups,

-- This creates a test entry to verify insert permissions work
