# Story 1.4: Shopping Cart and Session Management

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As a **customer**
- I want **a persistent shopping cart that saves my configured products**
- so that **I can continue shopping and review my order before purchasing**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- **AC1**: Floating side cart accessible from all pages
- **AC2**: Cart persists across browser sessions for registered users
- **AC3**: Quantity adjustment and item removal functionality
- **AC4**: Cart displays job configurations and pricing details
- **AC5**: Cart validation prevents invalid configurations
- **AC6**: Continue shopping functionality maintains cart state

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Cart integrates with existing React Query state management

### Data Models
**Cart State Management** [Source: architecture.md#data-models-and-schema-changes]:

**Cart Item Structure:**
```typescript
interface CartItem {
  id: string; // Unique cart item ID
  product_id: string;
  product_name: string;
  product_slug: string;
  quantity: number;
  unit_price: number;
  total_price: number;
  configuration: {
    paper_stock_id: string;
    coating_id: string;
    print_size_id: string;
    turnaround_time_id: string;
    add_on_ids: string[];
    custom_options: Record<string, any>;
  };
  configuration_display: {
    paper_stock_name: string;
    coating_name: string;
    print_size_name: string;
    turnaround_time_name: string;
    add_on_names: string[];
  };
  price_breakdown: {
    base_price: number;
    paper_stock_cost: number;
    coating_cost: number;
    add_on_costs: number[];
    broker_discount: number;
    subtotal: number;
  };
  added_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

**Cart State:**
```typescript
interface CartState {
  items: CartItem[];
  total_items: number;
  subtotal: number;
  tax_amount: number;
  shipping_cost: number;
  total_amount: number;
  user_id?: string;
  session_id: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### API Specifications
**Cart Management APIs** [Source: architecture.md#api-design-and-integration]:

**Cart Operations:**
- GET /api/cart - Get current user's cart
- POST /api/cart/items - Add item to cart
- PUT /api/cart/items/:id - Update cart item quantity or configuration
- DELETE /api/cart/items/:id - Remove item from cart
- DELETE /api/cart - Clear entire cart
- POST /api/cart/validate - Validate all cart items

**Cart Persistence:**
- POST /api/cart/sync - Sync guest cart with user account
- GET /api/cart/session/:sessionId - Get cart by session ID
- PUT /api/cart/session/:sessionId - Update session cart

### Component Specifications
