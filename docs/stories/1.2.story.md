# Story 1.2: Product Catalog API and Basic Admin Interface

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a **platform administrator**
- I want **API endpoints and admin interface for managing products and categories**
- so that **I can configure the product catalog before customer-facing features go live**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- **AC1**: REST API endpoints for CRUD operations on products and categories
- **AC2**: Admin interface for adding/editing products with all configuration options
- **AC3**: Bulk import functionality for initial product catalog setup
- **AC4**: Product image upload and management through Supabase storage
- **AC5**: Validation for product data integrity and required fields
- **AC6**: Preview functionality to see how products will appear to customers

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: API follows existing REST patterns and authentication middleware
- **IV2**: Admin interface uses existing Shadcn/UI components and styling
- **IV3**: File upload integrates with existing error handling patterns

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1 established comprehensive database schema with all tables, relationships, and sample data
- Database includes user_profiles, product_categories, vendors, products, and all global options tables
- RLS policies are configured for security with admin access patterns established
- Sample data is available for development and testing

### Data Models
**API Endpoints to Implement** [Source: architecture.md#api-design-and-integration]:

**Product Management APIs:**
- GET /api/products - List products with filtering and pagination
- POST /api/products - Create new product
- GET /api/products/:id - Get single product with full configuration
- PUT /api/products/:id - Update product
- DELETE /api/products/:id - Delete product

**Category Management APIs:**
- GET /api/categories - List categories with hierarchy
- POST /api/categories - Create new category
- GET /api/categories/:id - Get single category
- PUT /api/categories/:id - Update category
- DELETE /api/categories/:id - Delete category

**Vendor Management APIs:**
- GET /api/vendors - List vendors
- POST /api/vendors - Create new vendor
- GET /api/vendors/:id - Get single vendor
- PUT /api/vendors/:id - Update vendor
- DELETE /api/vendors/:id - Delete vendor

**Global Options APIs:**
- GET /api/paper-stocks - List paper stocks
- POST /api/paper-stocks - Create/update paper stock
- GET /api/coatings - List coatings
- POST /api/coatings - Create/update coating
- GET /api/print-sizes - List print sizes
- POST /api/print-sizes - Create/update print size
- GET /api/turnaround-times - List turnaround times
- POST /api/turnaround-times - Create/update turnaround time
- GET /api/add-ons - List add-ons
- POST /api/add-ons - Create/update add-on

### API Specifications
**Authentication Requirements** [Source: architecture.md#integration-approach]:
- All admin endpoints require authentication via Supabase Auth
- Admin access verified through user_profiles.broker_category_discounts containing 'admin' key
- Alternative admin access via email ending in '@gangrunprinting.com'
- API responses must include proper HTTP status codes and error messages

**Response Format Standards**:
```typescript
// Success response
{
  data: T,
  meta?: {
    total: number,
    page: number,
    limit: number
  }
}

// Error response
{
  error: {
    code: string,
    message: string,
    details?: any
  }
}
```

### Component Specifications
**Admin Interface Components** [Source: architecture.md#component-architecture]:

**AdminLayout Component:**
- Sidebar navigation with existing Shadcn/UI components
- Header with user authentication status and logout
- Main content area with responsive design
- Breadcrumb navigation for deep admin pages

**ProductListView Component:**
- Data table using existing Shadcn/UI Table component
- Search and filter functionality
- Pagination controls
- Action buttons for create/edit/delete operations

**ProductForm Component:**
- Form using existing React Hook Form patterns
- Validation with Zod schemas
- All product configuration options (category, vendor, pricing, etc.)
- Image upload interface
- Real-time preview functionality

**CategoryManager Component:**
- Tree view for hierarchical categories
- Drag-and-drop for category ordering
- In-line editing for category names
- Bulk operations for category management

### File Locations
**API Endpoints** [Source: architecture.md#source-tree-integration]:
- Create API routes in `src/api/` directory following existing patterns
- Implement middleware in `src/middleware/` for authentication
- Create types in `src/types/` for API request/response interfaces

**Admin Interface Components:**
- Create admin pages in `src/pages/admin/` directory
- Create admin components in `src/components/admin/` directory
- Create admin utilities in `src/utils/admin/` directory

**Shared Components:**
- Extend existing components in `src/components/` for reusable elements
- Create new hooks in `src/hooks/` for admin-specific logic
- Create forms in `src/components/forms/` for admin input handling

### Technical Constraints
**Integration Requirements** [Source: architecture.md#integration-approach]:
- Must use existing Supabase client configuration
- Must follow existing React Query patterns for data fetching
- Must use existing error handling and toast notification systems
- Must maintain existing TypeScript strict mode compliance

**Performance Requirements:**
- Admin interface must load in under 2 seconds
- Product listing must support pagination for large catalogs
- Image uploads must include progress indicators
- Form validation must be real-time without blocking UI

**Security Requirements:**
- All admin endpoints must verify user permissions
- File uploads must validate file types and sizes
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through proper input sanitization

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Unit Tests: Component testing for all admin interface components, coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Integration Test (Test Location): API endpoint testing in `/tests/api/admin.test.ts`
- [ ] E2E: Admin workflow testing for product creation and management

Manual Test Steps:
- Verify admin authentication prevents unauthorized access
- Test product creation with all configuration options
- Test bulk import functionality with sample CSV data
- Verify product preview matches customer view
- Test image upload and management functionality
- Verify validation prevents invalid product configurations
