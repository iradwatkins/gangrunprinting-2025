# Story 1.3: Dynamic Product Display and Configuration Interface

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As a **customer**
- I want **to browse products and configure printing options with real-time updates**
- so that **I can see exactly what I'm ordering and how much it will cost**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- **AC1**: Product catalog pages display real products from database
- **AC2**: Product detail pages show all configuration options (paper, size, coating, etc.)
- **AC3**: Configuration interface supports both guided and all-in-one flows
- **AC4**: Real-time price calculation as options are selected
- **AC5**: Product images and specifications display correctly
- **AC6**: Mobile-responsive design maintains usability on all devices

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Existing homepage product categories link to real product pages
- **IV2**: Navigation remains consistent with current header structure
- **IV3**: Loading states use existing skeleton components

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1 established comprehensive database schema with sample products and configurations
- Story 1.2 will provide API endpoints for product catalog management
- Sample data includes business cards, flyers, and postcards with full configuration options
- Database includes paper stocks, coatings, print sizes, turnaround times, and add-ons

### Data Models
**Product Display Data Structure** [Source: architecture.md#data-models-and-schema-changes]:

**Product Catalog View:**
```typescript
interface ProductCatalogItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  description: string;
  category: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    slug: string;
  };
  base_price: number;
  minimum_quantity: number;
  image_url?: string;
  is_active: boolean;
}
```

**Product Detail View:**
```typescript
interface ProductDetail {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  description: string;
  category: ProductCategory;
  vendor: Vendor;
  base_price: number;
  minimum_quantity: number;
  images: string[];
  specifications: Record<string, any>;
  available_options: {
    paper_stocks: PaperStock[];
    coatings: Coating[];
    print_sizes: PrintSize[];
    turnaround_times: TurnaroundTime[];
    add_ons: AddOn[];
  };
  default_configuration: ProductConfiguration;
}
```

**Configuration State:**
```typescript
interface ProductConfiguration {
  product_id: string;
  paper_stock_id: string;
  coating_id: string;
  print_size_id: string;
  turnaround_time_id: string;
  add_on_ids: string[];
  quantity: number;
  custom_options: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### API Specifications
**Product Catalog APIs** [Source: architecture.md#api-design-and-integration]:

**Product Listing:**
- GET /api/products?category=:slug&page=:page&limit=:limit&sort=:sort
