  broker_tier: 'standard' | 'premium' | 'elite';
  company_name: string;
  tax_id?: string;
  business_license?: string;
  broker_category_discounts: Record<string, number>; // category_slug -> discount_percentage

**Pricing Calculation:**
```typescript
interface PricingContext {
  user_id?: string;
  is_broker: boolean;
  broker_tier?: string;
  category_discounts: Record<string, number>;
  volume_tier?: VolumeTier;
  annual_volume: number;
}

interface PriceCalculation {
  base_price: number;
  category_discount?: number;
  volume_discount?: number;
  quantity_discount?: number;
  broker_price: number;
  retail_price: number;
  total_savings: number;
  savings_percentage: number;
  breakdown: PriceBreakdown[];
}

interface PriceBreakdown {
  type: 'base' | 'category_discount' | 'volume_discount' | 'quantity_discount';

}
```
