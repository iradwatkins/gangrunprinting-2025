# Story 1.15: Vendor Management Interface

## Status: Review ✅

## Story

- As a **platform administrator**
- I want **a complete admin interface for managing print vendors and their capabilities**
- so that **I can configure vendor relationships and ensure proper order routing and pricing**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- **AC1**: Admin interface displays all vendors with contact information and status
- **AC2**: Create/edit forms for vendor configuration including contact details and capabilities
- **AC3**: Vendor validation ensures required business information and contact details
- **AC4**: Vendor activation/deactivation affects product availability and order routing
- **AC5**: Interface shows product assignments and order volume per vendor
- **AC6**: Vendor performance tracking and rating system for quality management

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Vendor management integrates with existing AdminLayout component patterns
- **IV2**: Uses existing API endpoints from vendors.ts without modification  
- **IV3**: Vendor interface maintains consistency with other admin management pages

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
- **QA Finding**: Vendor API exists in `src/api/vendors.ts` but no admin interface available
- **Architecture Pattern**: Admin components follow existing ProductList.tsx and ProductForm.tsx patterns
- **Business Context**: Vendors are critical for order fulfillment and product pricing coordination

### Data Models [Source: architecture.md#data-models-and-schema-changes]
**Vendors Schema**:
- id: UUID - Primary key
- name: TEXT - Vendor company name
- slug: TEXT - URL-friendly identifier
- contact_name: TEXT - Primary contact person
- contact_email: TEXT - Primary email address
- contact_phone: TEXT - Primary phone number
- address: JSONB - Complete address information
- capabilities: JSONB - Printing capabilities and specialties
- pricing_tier: TEXT - Vendor pricing category
- turnaround_times: JSONB - Standard delivery timeframes
- is_active: BOOLEAN - Vendor availability status
- rating: DECIMAL(3,2) - Performance rating (0.00-5.00)
- notes: TEXT - Admin notes and special instructions
- created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ - Vendor onboarding date
- updated_at: TIMESTAMPTZ - Last modification timestamp

### API Specifications [Source: existing src/api/vendors.ts]
**Existing API Endpoints (DO NOT MODIFY)**:
- GET /api/vendors - List vendors with filtering and search
- POST /api/vendors - Create new vendor
- PUT /api/vendors/:id - Update existing vendor
- DELETE /api/vendors/:id - Delete vendor (with product assignment validation)
- vendorsApi.getVendors(filters) - TypeScript client method
- vendorsApi.createVendor(data) - Creation method with validation
- vendorsApi.updateVendor(id, data) - Update method
- vendorsApi.deleteVendor(id) - Deletion method with dependency checking

### Component Specifications [Source: architecture.md#component-architecture]
**File Locations**:
- Admin page: `src/pages/admin/VendorsPage.tsx`
- List component: `src/components/admin/VendorList.tsx`
- Form component: `src/components/admin/VendorForm.tsx`
- Performance tracker: `src/components/admin/VendorPerformanceTracker.tsx`

**Vendor Capabilities Structure**:
```tsx
interface VendorCapabilities {
  printing_methods: string[]; // Digital, Offset, Large Format, etc.
  paper_stocks: string[]; // Supported paper stock IDs
  max_quantity: number; // Maximum order quantity
  specialties: string[]; // Special services offered
  certifications: string[]; // Quality certifications
}
```

### Technical Constraints [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack-alignment]
- **UI Framework**: Use existing Shadcn/UI components for consistent admin interface
- **Address Handling**: JSONB field requires proper form handling for nested address data
- **File Uploads**: Support vendor documentation uploads (contracts, certifications)
- **Performance Metrics**: Integration with order system for performance tracking
- **Communication**: Email integration for vendor notifications
