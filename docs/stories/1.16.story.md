# Story 1.16: Real Data Integration (Replace Mock Data)

## Status: Review ✅

## Story

- As a **customer**
- I want **product pages to display real product information from the database**
- so that **I can see accurate pricing, availability, and configuration options for actual products**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- **AC1**: ProductDetail page loads real products from database via product API
- **AC2**: Product catalog pages display actual products with real categories and vendors
- **AC3**: Product configuration options come from real database relationships
- **AC4**: Product pricing calculations use real base prices and option costs
- **AC5**: Product availability reflects actual vendor and inventory status
- **AC6**: Product images load from Supabase storage instead of placeholder.svg

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Real data integration maintains existing component interfaces and props
- **IV2**: Loading states and error handling work correctly with API calls
- **IV3**: Product routing and navigation continue to function with real product IDs

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
- **Critical QA Finding**: ProductDetail.tsx uses mock data (line 18: `// Mock product data - in a real app, this would come from an API`)
- **Architecture Issue**: E-commerce flow broken due to disconnect between UI components and real database
- **Data Availability**: Database contains real products from Story 1.1 sample data seeding

### Data Models [Source: architecture.md#data-models-and-schema-changes + Story 1.1 Implementation]
**Product Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  description: string;
  category_id: string;
  vendor_id: string;
  base_price: number;
  is_active: boolean;
  minimum_quantity: number;
  images: string[];
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  // Relationships
  product_categories?: Category;
  vendors?: Vendor;
  product_paper_stocks?: ProductPaperStock[];
  product_print_sizes?: ProductPrintSize[];
  product_turnaround_times?: ProductTurnaroundTime[];
  product_add_ons?: ProductAddOn[];
}
```

### API Specifications [Source: existing src/api/products.ts]
**Existing API Endpoints (USE THESE)**:
- GET /api/products - List products with filtering and pagination
- GET /api/products/:id - Get single product with full configuration
- productsApi.getProducts(filters) - List products with relationships
- productsApi.getProduct(id) - Single product with all related data
- productsApi.getProductBySlug(slug) - Product lookup by URL slug

**Product Relationship Loading**:
```typescript
// Product with all relationships loaded
const productWithRelations = await productsApi.getProduct(id, {
  include: ['category', 'vendor', 'paper_stocks', 'print_sizes', 'turnaround_times', 'add_ons']
});
```

### Component Specifications [Source: current implementation analysis]
**Files to Modify**:
- `src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx` - Replace mock data with API calls
- `src/pages/ProductCatalog.tsx` - Ensure real product loading
- `src/components/products/ProductCard.tsx` - Handle real product data
- `src/components/products/ProductConfiguration.tsx` - Use real configuration options

**Mock Data to Replace** [Source: QA finding in ProductDetail.tsx]:
```typescript
// REMOVE THIS MOCK DATA:
const mockProduct = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Premium Business Cards",
  category: "Business Cards", 
  basePrice: 39.99,
  description: "High-quality business cards...",
  images: ["/placeholder.svg", "/placeholder.svg", "/placeholder.svg"],
  // ... more mock data
};
```

### Technical Constraints [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack-alignment]
- **State Management**: Use existing React Query setup for API calls
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper loading states and error boundaries  
- **Performance**: Add proper caching for product data and related options
- **SEO**: Maintain existing slug-based routing for product URLs
- **Image Handling**: Integrate with Supabase Storage for real product images
