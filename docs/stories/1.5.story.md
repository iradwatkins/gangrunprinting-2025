# Story 1.5: User Authentication and Account System Enhancement

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **customer**
- I want **to create an account and manage my profile information**
- so that **I can track orders, save preferences, and access broker pricing if applicable**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- **AC1**: User registration with email verification
- **AC2**: Login/logout functionality with session management
- **AC3**: Profile management for contact and billing information
- **AC4**: Broker account type support with special permissions
- **AC5**: Password reset and account recovery flows
- **AC6**: Account dashboard with navigation to key features

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: New auth flows extend existing Supabase Auth without breaking current setup

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1 established user_profiles table with broker support
- Story 1.2 will provide admin interfaces for user management
- Story 1.3 will provide product browsing that needs user context
- Story 1.4 will provide cart functionality that needs user persistence

### Data Models
**User Profile Enhancement** [Source: architecture.md#data-models-and-schema-changes]:

**Extended User Profile:**
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  user_id: string; // References auth.users.id
  is_broker: boolean;
  broker_category_discounts: Record<string, number>;
  company_name?: string;
  phone?: string;
  profile_picture_url?: string;
  billing_address?: Address;
  shipping_addresses: Address[];
  preferences: UserPreferences;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

interface Address {
  id: string;
  label: string; // "Home", "Office", etc.
  first_name: string;
  last_name: string;
  company?: string;
  street_address: string;
  street_address_2?: string;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  postal_code: string;
  country: string;
  phone?: string;
  is_default: boolean;
}

interface UserPreferences {
  language: 'en' | 'es';
  currency: 'USD';
  email_notifications: {
    order_updates: boolean;
    marketing: boolean;
    promotions: boolean;
  };
  display_preferences: {
    theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'auto';
    pricing_display: 'per_unit' | 'total';
  };
}
```

### API Specifications
**User Management APIs** [Source: architecture.md#api-design-and-integration]:

**Authentication:**
- POST /api/auth/register - User registration with email verification
- POST /api/auth/login - User login (handled by Supabase Auth)
- POST /api/auth/logout - User logout with session cleanup
- POST /api/auth/forgot-password - Password reset request
- POST /api/auth/reset-password - Password reset confirmation

**Profile Management:**
- GET /api/profile - Get current user profile
- PUT /api/profile - Update user profile
- POST /api/profile/picture - Upload profile picture
- GET /api/profile/addresses - Get user addresses
- POST /api/profile/addresses - Add new address
- PUT /api/profile/addresses/:id - Update address
- DELETE /api/profile/addresses/:id - Delete address

**Broker Management:**
- POST /api/broker/request - Request broker status
- GET /api/broker/status - Get broker application status
- GET /api/broker/discounts - Get broker discount rates

### Component Specifications
**Authentication Components** [Source: architecture.md#component-architecture]:

**AuthModal Component:**
- Login/Register modal using Shadcn/UI Dialog
- Tab switching between login and register
- Form validation with Zod schemas
- Social login integration (if applicable)

**ProfileForm Component:**

- Dashboard layout with navigation sidebar
- Quick stats and recent activity
- Account notifications and alerts
- Navigation to key features

**BrokerInterface Component:**

- Discount rate display
- Broker application status
- Special pricing indicators

### File Locations
**Authentication Components** [Source: architecture.md#source-tree-integration]:
- Create auth components in `src/components/auth/` directory
- Create profile components in `src/components/profile/` directory
- Create account pages in `src/pages/account/` directory

**Authentication Context and Hooks:**
- Extend auth context in `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`
- Create auth hooks in `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- Create profile hooks in `src/hooks/useProfile.ts`

**Authentication API:**
- Create auth API utilities in `src/api/auth/` directory
- Create profile API utilities in `src/api/profile/` directory
- Create auth types in `src/types/auth.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Supabase Integration** [Source: architecture.md#integration-approach]:
- Must use existing Supabase Auth configuration
- Must not break existing auth.users table structure
- Must integrate with existing RLS policies
- Must maintain existing session management

**Security Requirements:**
- All auth endpoints must use HTTPS
- Password requirements must be enforced
- Session tokens must be properly managed
- User data must be protected with RLS policies

**Performance Requirements:**
- Auth operations must complete in under 2 seconds
- Profile updates must be optimistic with rollback
- Address management must be responsive
- Account dashboard must load quickly

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Unit Tests: Authentication and profile component testing, coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Integration Test (Test Location): Auth flow integration testing in `/tests/auth/auth.test.ts`
- [ ] E2E: Complete user registration and profile management workflow testing

Manual Test Steps:
- Test user registration with email verification
- Test login/logout functionality with session management
- Test profile editing with all fields and validation
- Test broker account request and approval workflow
- Test password reset and recovery flows
- Test account dashboard navigation and functionality
