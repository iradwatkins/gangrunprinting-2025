# Story 1.5: User Authentication and Account System Enhancement

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As a **customer**
- I want **to create an account and manage my profile information**
- so that **I can track orders, save preferences, and access broker pricing if applicable**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- **AC1**: User registration with email verification

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1 established user_profiles table with broker support
- Story 1.2 will provide admin interfaces for user management
- Story 1.3 will provide product browsing that needs user context
- Story 1.4 will provide cart functionality that needs user persistence

### Data Models
**User Profile Enhancement** [Source: architecture.md#data-models-and-schema-changes]:

**Extended User Profile:**
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  user_id: string; // References auth.users.id
  is_broker: boolean;
  broker_category_discounts: Record<string, number>;
  company_name?: string;
  phone?: string;
  profile_picture_url?: string;
  billing_address?: Address;
  shipping_addresses: Address[];
  preferences: UserPreferences;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

interface Address {
  id: string;
  label: string; // "Home", "Office", etc.
  first_name: string;
  last_name: string;
  company?: string;
  street_address: string;
  street_address_2?: string;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  postal_code: string;
  country: string;
  phone?: string;
  is_default: boolean;
}

interface UserPreferences {
  language: 'en' | 'es';
  currency: 'USD';
  email_notifications: {
    order_updates: boolean;
    marketing: boolean;
    promotions: boolean;
  };
  display_preferences: {
    theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'auto';
    pricing_display: 'per_unit' | 'total';
  };
}
```

### API Specifications
**User Management APIs** [Source: architecture.md#api-design-and-integration]:

**Authentication:**
- POST /api/auth/register - User registration with email verification
- POST /api/auth/login - User login (handled by Supabase Auth)
- POST /api/auth/logout - User logout with session cleanup
- POST /api/auth/forgot-password - Password reset request
- POST /api/auth/reset-password - Password reset confirmation

**Profile Management:**
- GET /api/profile - Get current user profile
- PUT /api/profile - Update user profile
- POST /api/profile/picture - Upload profile picture
- GET /api/profile/addresses - Get user addresses
- POST /api/profile/addresses - Add new address
- PUT /api/profile/addresses/:id - Update address

### Technical Constraints
**Supabase Integration** [Source: architecture.md#integration-approach]:
- Must use existing Supabase Auth configuration
- Must not break existing auth.users table structure
- Must integrate with existing RLS policies
- Must maintain existing session management

**Security Requirements:**
- All auth endpoints must use HTTPS
- Password requirements must be enforced
- Session tokens must be properly managed
- User data must be protected with RLS policies

**Performance Requirements:**
- Auth operations must complete in under 2 seconds
- Profile updates must be optimistic with rollback
- Address management must be responsive
- Account dashboard must load quickly
