# Story 1.7: File Upload and Artwork Management

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a **customer**
- I want **to upload artwork files for my print jobs**
- so that **my custom designs can be printed according to my specifications**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- **AC1**: File upload interface with drag-and-drop functionality
- **AC2**: Support for multiple file formats (PDF, JPG, PNG, etc.) with size limits
- **AC3**: File validation and error messaging for unsupported formats
- **AC4**: File preview and management interface
- **AC5**: Secure file storage through Supabase Storage
- **AC6**: File association with specific order jobs

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: File upload uses existing loading states and progress indicators
- **IV2**: Error handling integrates with existing toast notification system
- **IV3**: File storage doesn't impact existing Supabase storage usage

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1 established order_jobs table with artwork_files JSONB field
- Story 1.4 provides shopping cart functionality that will need file attachments
- Story 1.6 provides checkout process that creates orders with file associations
- Database supports file references in JSONB format for flexible file management

### Data Models
**File Management Data Structure** [Source: architecture.md#data-models-and-schema-changes]:

**Artwork File:**
```typescript
interface ArtworkFile {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  order_job_id?: string; // Optional until assigned to order
  original_filename: string;
  stored_filename: string;
  file_path: string;
  file_size: number;
  file_type: string;
  mime_type: string;
  dimensions?: {
    width: number;
    height: number;
    dpi: number;
  };
  color_space?: string;
  validation_status: 'pending' | 'valid' | 'invalid' | 'needs_review';
  validation_notes?: string;
  preview_url?: string;
  thumbnail_url?: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

interface FileUploadProgress {
  file_id: string;
  filename: string;
  progress: number;
  status: 'uploading' | 'processing' | 'complete' | 'error';
  error_message?: string;
}
```

**File Association:**
```typescript
interface OrderJobFile {
  order_job_id: string;
  artwork_file_id: string;
  file_purpose: 'artwork' | 'reference' | 'proof';
  is_primary: boolean;
  position: number;
  notes?: string;
}
```

### API Specifications

**Performance Requirements:**
- File uploads must show progress and be resumable
- File previews must load quickly with lazy loading
- File validation must complete in under 5 seconds
- File management interface must be responsive
