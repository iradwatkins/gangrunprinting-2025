- Error states must use existing alert and toast notification systems

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript
**Frameworks**: React 18, Vite (build), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI
**Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
**Infrastructure**: Supabase (BaaS), Vercel/Netlify (deployment)
**External Dependencies**: React Query, React Hook Form, Zod, Lucide React, Embla Carousel

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Extend existing Supabase schema with new tables for products, orders, customers, and CRM data while maintaining current user authentication structure

**API Integration Strategy**: Build new REST endpoints following existing patterns, integrate with Supabase Edge Functions for complex business logic, and maintain existing error handling

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Extend existing component library, integrate with current routing structure, and enhance existing state management with React Query

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Implement component testing with existing patterns, add integration tests for new API endpoints, and maintain current build pipeline

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Follow existing src/ directory structure with new features/, api/, and store/ directories as outlined in Frontend Architecture

**Naming Conventions**: Maintain existing TypeScript naming conventions, React component patterns, and API endpoint structures

**Coding Standards**: Continue using existing ESLint configuration, TypeScript strict mode, and Prettier formatting

**Documentation Standards**: Add JSDoc comments for new components and maintain existing README structure

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Extend existing Vite build configuration with new environment variables and optimization settings

**Deployment Strategy**: Deploy frontend to existing Vercel/Netlify setup, configure Supabase Edge Functions for backend logic

**Monitoring and Logging**: Integrate with Supabase logging, implement error tracking for production issues

**Configuration Management**: Extend existing environment variable management with new API keys and configuration options

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- Complex pricing engine may impact performance - mitigate with caching strategies
- File upload system may cause storage issues - implement size limits and cleanup processes
- Payment gateway integration may fail - implement proper error handling and fallbacks

**Integration Risks**: 
- Supabase schema changes may affect existing auth - test thoroughly in staging environment
- New API endpoints may conflict with existing routes - follow established naming conventions

**Deployment Risks**: 
- Large database migrations may cause downtime - plan incremental schema updates
- New environment variables may break existing deployment - maintain backwards compatibility

**Mitigation Strategies**: 
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage
- Use database transactions for all critical operations
- Implement proper error boundaries and fallback UI
