# Build Fixes and Square Payment Consolidation

**Date:** August 14, 2025, 1:15 PM CST
**Agent:** BMAD Orchestrator
**Status:** COMPLETED ✅

## Problem Statement
Multiple build errors preventing production deployment:
- Missing UI components (radio-group, slider)
- Deprecated NextAuth imports
- PaymentGatewayService import errors
- Stripe webhook errors (AGI Staffers uses Square only)
- Missing Suspense boundary in analytics page

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Fixed Missing UI Components
**Issue:** Build failing due to missing Radix UI components
**Solution:** 
- Installed `@radix-ui/react-radio-group`
- Installed `@radix-ui/react-slider`
- Installed `canvas-confetti`
- Created wrapper components in `/components/ui/`

### 2. Updated NextAuth Imports
**Issue:** Using deprecated `next-auth/next` imports
**Solution:**
- Changed `getServerSession(authOptions)` to `auth()`
- Updated all API routes to use new auth pattern
- Fixed admin stats route authentication

### 3. Consolidated to Square-Only Payments
**Business Requirement:** AGI Staffers uses Square EXCLUSIVELY
**Changes Made:**
- Replaced Stripe webhook with placeholder (returns 501)
- Replaced bank deposit endpoints with placeholders
- Updated payment methods to only support Square
- Added Square webhook signature key: `ypaSh1d4N1Ak4_Vgch9m9A`

### 4. Fixed Suspense Boundary Issue
**Issue:** `useSearchParams()` without Suspense boundary
**Solution:**
- Wrapped analytics page content in Suspense
- Created separate `AnalyticsContent` component
- Added loading spinner fallback

## Files Modified

### API Routes Simplified for Square:
- `/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - Now returns 501 (not implemented)
- `/api/payment/bank-deposit/route.ts` - Now returns 501 (not implemented)
- `/api/payment/methods/route.ts` - Only returns Square as option
- `/api/admin/bank-deposits/[id]/verify/route.ts` - Simplified without PaymentGatewayService

### UI Components Created:
- `/components/ui/radio-group.tsx`
- `/components/ui/slider.tsx`

### Pages Fixed:
- `/app/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx` - Added Suspense boundary
- `/app/onboarding/page.tsx` - Fixed auth import

## Environment Updates
```env
SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY="ypaSh1d4N1Ak4_Vgch9m9A"
```

## Build Status
✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** - All errors resolved

## Key Business Decisions
1. **Square Only**: All payment processing through Square
2. **No Stripe**: Stripe endpoints return 501 status
3. **No Bank Deposits**: Not part of current payment flow
4. **Webhook URL**: https://admin.agistaffers.com/api/webhooks/square
5. **Subscription ID**: wbhk_0fd48eb8cc854946906d5371510e7321

## Testing Verification
```bash
# Build test passed
npm run build
# ✓ Compiled successfully
# ✓ Generated static pages (84/84)
```

## MCP Tools Used
- None required for these fixes (direct code modifications)

## Next Steps
1. Test Square payment flow end-to-end
2. Configure production environment variables
3. Deploy to production using blue-green workflow

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ All pages generate successfully
- ✅ Square webhook configured
- ✅ Payment system consolidated to Square only
- ✅ Ready for production deployment
