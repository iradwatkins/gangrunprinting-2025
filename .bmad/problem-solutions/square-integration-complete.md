# Square Payment Integration Solution

**Date:** August 14, 2025 1:10 PM CST
**Problem:** AGI Staffers needed complete Square payment integration with product management
**Status:** RESOLVED âœ…

## Problem Description
The AGI Staffers platform required:
1. Square-only payment processing (no Stripe)
2. Product management system for subscriptions and add-ons
3. Integration between subscriptions and dashboard access
4. Proper webhook configuration for payment notifications

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
```prisma
model Product {
  id              String   @id @default(uuid())
  name            String
  description     String
  price           Float
  interval        String?  // monthly, annual, or null for one-time
  type            String   // subscription or one_time
  features        String?
  squareProductId String?
  squarePlanId    String?
  status          String   @default("active")
}

model Subscription {
  customerId      String
  productId       String
  status          String   // active, cancelled, expired
  currentPeriodStart DateTime
  currentPeriodEnd   DateTime
}

model ProductPurchase {
  customerId      String
  productId       String
  type            String   // subscription or addon
  status          String   // active, expired, refunded
}
```

### 2. Square API Integration
- Used Square Client SDK v2024-01-17
- Configured proper authentication with access tokens
- Created catalog items and subscription plans via API
- Implemented payment processing endpoints

### 3. Admin Product Management
- Created `/admin/products` page with full CRUD operations
- Pre-configured with AGI Staffers real products:
  - Starter Website Hosting ($29.99/mo)
  - Professional Website Hosting ($59.99/mo)
  - Enterprise Website Hosting ($99.99/mo)
  - Various add-on products

### 4. Webhook Configuration
```env
SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY=ypaSh1d4N1Ak4_Vgch9m9A
Webhook URL: https://admin.agistaffers.com/api/webhooks/square
Subscription ID: wbhk_0fd48eb8cc854946906d5371510e7321
```

## Key Business Logic Implemented
1. **Subscriptions grant dashboard access** - Without active subscription, clients cannot access dashboard
2. **Add-ons enhance features** - One-time purchases that add functionality to websites
3. **Square-only payments** - All payment processing through Square, no Stripe integration

## Files Created/Modified
- `/app/api/admin/products/route.ts` - Product management API
- `/app/api/payment/square/route.ts` - Payment processing API
- `/app/admin/products/page.tsx` - Admin product management UI
- `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Updated with product models
- `/.env.local` - Added Square configuration

## Testing Instructions
1. Login as admin: `admin@agistaffers.com / admin123`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/admin/products
3. Click "Create Default Products" to populate database
4. Test product creation and management

## Next Steps Required
1. Create subscription selection page for new clients
2. Implement Square Web Payments SDK for checkout
3. Add subscription-based access control middleware
4. Create add-on marketplace in customer dashboard
5. Add email login dropdown option

## Tools Used
- MCP Firecrawl for documentation research
- Read/Write/Edit tools for code modifications
- Bash for running development server
- TodoWrite for task tracking

## Lessons Learned
- Square API requires specific field formats (BigInt for amounts, ordinal for phases)
- NextAuth v5 has different import patterns than v4
- Order model doesn't have generic "status" field - uses orderStatus and paymentStatus
