# üö® CRITICAL HANDOFF: BROKEN BUILD RECOVERY
**Date:** August 13, 2025 - 7:20 PM CST  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Production good, Local broken  
**Context Limit:** Previous session at 190k tokens  

---

## üî¥ PART 1: WHAT HAPPENED

### The Sequence of Events:
1. **Started with working local build** - Both agistaffers.com and admin.agistaffers.com were running
2. **User requested cleanup** - Found 60GB storage usage, many duplicates
3. **Aggressive cleanup performed**:
   - Deleted .next cache (558MB)
   - Archived old directories (596MB in .archives)
   - Reorganized entire folder structure
   - Created /demo/dawn-store with new code
4. **BUILD BROKE** - Static files now return 404, webpack cache corrupted

### Current State:
```
‚úÖ PRODUCTION WORKS: agistaffers.com and admin.agistaffers.com are LIVE and WORKING
‚ùå LOCALHOST BROKEN: 404 errors on all CSS/JS files
‚ùå ERRORS: "ENOENT: no such file or directory" in .next/cache/webpack
```

---

## üîµ PART 2: WHAT WE NEED TO DO

### IMMEDIATE RECOVERY PLAN:

#### Step 1: BACKUP CURRENT STATE
```bash
# DO THIS FIRST - NO EXCEPTIONS
cd /Users/irawatkins/Documents/Cursor\ Setup
cp -r agistaffers agistaffers-broken-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

#### Step 2: NUCLEAR CLEAN
```bash
cd agistaffers
rm -rf .next node_modules .turbo .cache
npm cache clean --force
```

#### Step 3: FRESH INSTALL
```bash
npm install
npm run build  # NOT dev - build first
npm run start  # Test in production mode
```

#### Step 4: VERIFY
- Check http://localhost:3000 (main site)
- Check http://localhost:3000/admin (admin site)
- NO 404 errors should appear

#### Step 5: IF STILL BROKEN - PULL FROM PRODUCTION
```bash
# Production is WORKING - use it as source of truth
# Download the deployment from your hosting provider
# Replace local with known-good production code
```

## üü° PART 3: WHY IT HAPPENED

### Root Causes:
1. **Mixed production/dev files** - Dawn demo added to production app
2. **Aggressive cleanup** - Deleted build caches while server running
3. **No staging test** - Changes made directly to main app
4. **Context overflow** - At 190k tokens, missed critical details

### What Was Lost:
- PROJECT-STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS.md (documented what was duplicate)
- Working webpack cache
- Proper static file references
