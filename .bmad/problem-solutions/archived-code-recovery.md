# Problem: Archived Code Recovery

**Date:** August 14, 2025, 8:40 PM CST
**Problem:** Essential customer dashboard code was archived during cleanup
**Solution:** Recovered components from archive and properly integrated

## Problem Description
During the cleanup process, customer dashboard components were moved to the archive folder. These components were already built and functional but not integrated into the main application.

## Files Recovered
1. **CustomerSidebar.tsx** - Full customer navigation component
   - Source: `.archives/cleanup-2025-08-14/agistaffers-broken-backup-20250813-211036/components/dashboard/`
   - Features: Collapsible sidebar, tooltips, mobile responsive, user session integration

2. **seed-customer.ts** - Customer account creation script
   - Source: `.archives/cleanup-2025-08-14/agistaffers-broken-backup-20250813-211036/scripts/`
   - Purpose: Creates test customer accounts with sample data

3. **Deployment Scripts**
   - Source: `/config/scripts/`
   - Files: blue-green-deploy.sh, infrastructure scripts

## Integration Steps Taken
1. Created BMAD documentation structure for tracking
2. Copied components from archive to main application
3. Integrated CustomerSidebar with dashboard layout
4. Configured routing and authentication
5. Tested customer login flow

## Tools Used
- MCP File operations for recovery
- VS Code for integration
- Git for version control

## Verification
- Customer dashboard accessible at `/dashboard`
- CustomerSidebar navigation working
- Authentication flow functional
- All routes properly configured

## Lessons Learned
- Always check archives before rebuilding features
- Maintain proper BMAD documentation to track implementations
- Use systematic approach for code recovery
