# Blue-Green Deployment Implementation Status
**Last Updated:** August 12, 2025 - 10:36 PM CST

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED
1. **Blue-Green Infrastructure Setup**
   - Created deployment scripts (blue-green-deploy.sh, blue-green-rollback.sh)
   - Documentation in `.bmad/docs/blue-green-deployment.md`
   - Assembly line workflow: LOCAL ‚Üí STANDBY ‚Üí LIVE

2. **GitHub Actions Configuration**
   - Created `.github/workflows/blue-green-deploy.yml`
   - Added SSH key authentication
   - GitHub secrets configured (VPS_HOST, VPS_USER, VPS_KEY)
   - Disabled 5 old conflicting workflows

3. **Codebase Cleanup**
   - Archived 37 old documentation files
   - Consolidated 34 deployment scripts to 2
   - Enabled middleware for subdomain routing
   - Freed 549MB cache space
   - Clean Git baseline established

4. **API Route Fixes**
   - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to:
     - All admin auth routes
     - All backup API routes  
     - Templates, sites, customers routes
     - Metrics and payment routes
   - Prevents static generation of dynamic routes

## ‚ùå CURRENT BLOCKER
**Dialog Component Build Error**
- Next.js attempting to statically pre-render client components
- Error: `DialogPortal must be used within Dialog`
- Affects admin pages: alerts, support, automation, backups
- Build fails with exit code 1

## üîß ATTEMPTED FIXES
1. Added force-dynamic exports to API routes ‚úÖ
2. Created admin layout.tsx with force-dynamic ‚úÖ
3. Updated next.config.js with experimental.appDir ‚úÖ
4. **Still failing** - Dialog context not available during SSR

## üìã NEXT STEPS
1. **Option A: Skip Build, Deploy Dev Mode**
   - Modify deployment to use `npm run dev` instead of build
   - Faster deployment, bypasses SSR issues
   - Less optimized but functional

2. **Option B: Fix Dialog Components**
   - Wrap Dialog usage with proper client boundaries
   - Add runtime checks for Dialog context
   - More work but proper solution

3. **Option C: Disable Pre-rendering**
   - Configure Next.js to skip static generation entirely
   - Use `output: 'export'` with dynamic routes only
   - Middle ground approach

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STATUS
- **GitHub Actions:** Configured and authenticating correctly
- **Build Process:** Failing at Dialog component rendering
- **VPS Ready:** 72.60.28.175 configured with PM2 and NGINX
- **Blue-Green Setup:** Scripts ready, awaiting successful build

## üìù RECOMMENDATION
**Immediate Action:** Deploy using dev mode (Option A) to get working version online
**Follow-up:** Fix Dialog components properly for production builds

## üîÑ HANDOFF NOTES
If starting new session:
1. Check `gh run list --workflow blue-green-deploy.yml --repo iradwatkins/agi-staffers-infrastructure`
2. Dialog errors in `/admin/*` pages during build
3. Consider dev mode deployment: modify workflow to skip build
4. VPS credentials in deploy scripts
5. All code changes committed and pushed to main
