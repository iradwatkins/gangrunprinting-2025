## 🚨 Critical Path Items

1. **Square Web Payments SDK** - Blocks all payment processing
2. **Subscription Selection Page** - Blocks new client onboarding
3. **Access Control Middleware** - Blocks subscription enforcement

---

## 📝 Business Rules (IMMUTABLE)

1. **Square is the ONLY payment processor** - No Stripe, no alternatives
2. **Subscriptions = Dashboard Access** - No subscription, no dashboard
3. **Add-ons = Feature Enhancements** - One-time purchases for extras
4. **Three subscription tiers:**
   - Starter: $29.99/mo
   - Professional: $59.99/mo
   - Enterprise: $99.99/mo
