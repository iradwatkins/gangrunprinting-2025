# BMAD Story: Vault Security Management Training

**Story ID**: BMAD-003
**Created**: August 12, 2025
**Agent**: BMad Orchestrator
**Status**: BACKLOG - DEFERRED  
**Dependencies**: BMAD-001 completion + infrastructure 100% complete
**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Complete infrastructure setup (BMAD-001 + remaining work)

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive Vault secrets management training for user after infrastructure setup is complete. This includes security hardening, credential rotation, team access controls, and application integration best practices.

## BMAD Method Application

### üéØ BENCHMARK Phase
**Current State:**
- User successfully logged into Vault with root token
- Can view existing secrets (VPS, VAPID, MinIO credentials)
- Basic navigation understanding achieved
- Infrastructure setup still in progress

**Knowledge Gaps to Address:**
- Secret lifecycle management
- Access control and policies  
- Application integration patterns
- Security best practices
- Team collaboration workflows

### üèóÔ∏è MODEL Phase
**Training Structure:**

1. **Hands-on Secret Management**
   - Browse and audit all current secrets
   - Update/rotate existing credentials
   - Add new service secrets
   - Organize secret hierarchy

2. **Security Hardening**
   - Change VPS root password (currently exposed in files)
   - Implement secret rotation schedule
   - Set up audit logging
   - Configure backup procedures

3. **Access Control Setup**
   - Create policies for different team roles
   - Set up authentication methods beyond root token
   - Implement least-privilege access
   - Configure secret versioning

4. **Application Integration**
   - Show how to use Vault secrets in Docker containers
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
   - Configure dynamic secrets where applicable
   - Set up secret injection patterns

### üìä ANALYZE Phase
**Training Approach:**
- Interactive, hands-on demonstration
- Focus on practical AGI Staffers use cases
- Security-first mindset
- Gradual complexity introduction

**Success Metrics:**
- User can independently manage secrets
- Proper security practices implemented
- Team access controls configured
- Application integration working

### üöÄ DELIVER Phase
**Training Deliverables:**

1. **Secret Inventory & Cleanup**
   - Audit all current secrets
   - Rotate exposed credentials
   - Organize secret naming conventions
   - Document secret purposes

2. **Security Implementation**
   - New VPS password generation and rotation
   - Enable audit logging
   - Set up secret backup procedures
   - Implement access policies

3. **Team Collaboration Setup**
   - Configure authentication methods
   - Create role-based policies
   - Set up team member access
   - Document workflows

4. **Integration Documentation**
   - How to use secrets in applications
   - CI/CD integration patterns
   - Dynamic secret examples
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Training Topics Detailed

### 1. Secret Management Basics
- Navigate Vault UI effectively
- Create, read, update, delete secrets
- Understand secret versioning
- Use secret metadata and tags

### 2. Security Best Practices
- Principle of least privilege
- Secret rotation strategies
- Audit trail maintenance
- Backup and recovery procedures

### 3. Access Control
- Authentication methods (tokens, GitHub, OIDC)
- Policy creation and management
- Role-based access control
- Secret sharing patterns

### 4. Application Integration
- Environment variable injection
- API-based secret retrieval
- Dynamic secret generation
- Secret caching strategies

### 5. Operational Procedures
- Regular security audits
- Incident response for secret exposure
- Team onboarding/offboarding
- Compliance and governance
