# PWA-002: Mobile PWA Installation Enhancement

## Story Information
- **ID**: PWA-002  
- **Title**: Enhanced Mobile PWA Installation Experience
- **Epic**: Phase 3 - PWA Enhancement
- **Priority**: P1 (High)
- **Estimate**: 3 hours
- **Owner**: dev-agent
- **Editors**: dev-agent, qa-agent

## Description

Implement comprehensive mobile PWA installation prompts and ensure optimal offline functionality for admin.agistaffers.com. This includes install prompt UI, offline capability verification, and specific testing on Samsung Galaxy Fold 6.

**User Story**: As an AGI Staffers administrator using mobile devices, I want to install the admin dashboard as a PWA app so I can access monitoring capabilities offline and have a native app-like experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-001**: PWA installation prompt appears appropriately on mobile devices
- [ ] **AC-002**: Custom install prompt UI matches shadcn/ui design system
- [ ] **AC-003**: Installation works correctly on Samsung Galaxy Fold 6 (both folded and unfolded)
- [ ] **AC-004**: PWA installs and launches properly on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- [ ] **AC-005**: Offline functionality works for cached dashboard views
- [ ] **AC-006**: Install prompt respects user dismissal preferences
- [ ] **AC-007**: PWA manifest includes all required icons and metadata
- [ ] **AC-008**: Before install prompt shows installation benefits and features

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack Compliance
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 PWA with existing service worker v2.0.1
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui Button, Card, Dialog for install prompts
- **State Management**: React hooks for installation state tracking
- **Storage**: localStorage for user prompt preferences

### PWA Technical Requirements  
- **Manifest**: Complete web app manifest with all icon sizes
- **Service Worker**: Leverage existing sw.js v2.0.1 with offline caching
- **Icons**: 192x192 and 512x512 icons (already exist)
- **Offline Support**: Cache critical dashboard views and data

## Implementation Notes

### Current PWA State
From project analysis:
- âœ… Service worker v2.0.1 operational with smart caching
- âœ… Web app manifest exists at `/agistaffers/public/manifest.json`
- âœ… PWA icons already generated (192x192, 512x512)
- ðŸ”„ Need enhanced install prompt UI
- ðŸ”„ Need offline functionality verification

### Key Files to Implement/Modify
- `/agistaffers/components/dashboard/PWAInstallPrompt.tsx` (enhance)
- `/agistaffers/components/pwa-install-banner.tsx` (enhance) 
- `/agistaffers/components/pwa-install-button.tsx` (enhance)
- `/agistaffers/hooks/use-pwa-install.ts` (complete implementation)
- `/agistaffers/public/manifest.json` (verify completeness)

### Required Components (shadcn/ui)
- `Dialog` for installation prompt modal
- `Button` for install action
- `Card` for installation benefits display  
- `Badge` for offline status indicator
- `Alert` for installation success/error feedback

### Samsung Galaxy Fold 6 Considerations
- Test PWA in both folded (cover screen) and unfolded modes
- Ensure responsive design works across all screen configurations
- Verify touch targets are appropriately sized for both modes
- Test installation prompt positioning and readability

## Existing Tool Integration
- **Service Worker**: Use existing v2.0.1 for offline caching
- **Monitoring**: Integrate with metrics API for offline data access
- **Admin Dashboard**: Ensure all PWA features work with existing dashboard

## Data Protection Measures
- **No Backend Impact**: This story is purely frontend PWA enhancement
- **Local Storage Only**: Installation preferences stored locally
- **No Data Transmission**: Offline functionality uses cached data only
- **Privacy Compliant**: No additional user data collection required

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Samsung Galaxy Fold 6 installation testing (folded/unfolded)
- [ ] iOS Safari PWA installation and functionality
- [ ] Android Chrome PWA installation and functionality
- [ ] Offline functionality testing with network disabled
- [ ] Install prompt user flow testing (accept/dismiss/later)
- [ ] PWA manifest validation and icon display testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Dependencies

- Existing service worker v2.0.1 must remain operational
- Web app manifest must be valid and complete
- PWA icons must be properly sized and optimized
- Admin dashboard core functionality must be unaffected

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] Samsung Galaxy Fold 6 installation tested and confirmed working
- [ ] PWA installs successfully on major mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- [ ] Offline functionality verified and documented
- [ ] Install prompt UI follows shadcn/ui design patterns
- [ ] Code follows TypeScript strict mode requirements
- [ ] No regressions in existing dashboard functionality
- [ ] PWA audit scores remain high (>90 for all categories)

## Notes

This story builds on existing PWA infrastructure and focuses on mobile-first installation experience. The Samsung Galaxy Fold 6 requirement comes from CLAUDE.md specifications for responsive design testing.
