# INFRA-005: Automated Backup System Enhancement

## Story Information
- **ID**: INFRA-005
- **Title**: Comprehensive Automated Backup System
- **Epic**: Phase 3 - Enterprise Infrastructure
- **Priority**: P1 (High - Data Protection Critical)
- **Estimate**: 5 hours
- **Owner**: dev-agent
- **Editors**: dev-agent, qa-agent

## Description

Enhance and systematize the automated backup system using n8n workflows to ensure comprehensive data protection for PostgreSQL databases, container configurations, and customer data. This builds on existing backup infrastructure while adding enterprise-grade reliability and monitoring.

**User Story**: As an AGI Staffers system administrator, I want automated, reliable backups of all critical data and configurations so I can guarantee data recovery and maintain business continuity in case of system failures.

- [ ] **AC-002**: Container configuration backups (docker-compose, env files)
- [ ] **AC-003**: Customer website data and file backups
- [ ] **AC-004**: Backup integrity verification and automated testing
- [ ] **AC-005**: n8n workflow automation for all backup processes
- [ ] **AC-006**: Backup monitoring dashboard in admin interface
- [ ] **AC-007**: Encrypted backup storage with multiple retention policies
- [ ] **AC-008**: Automated backup failure alerts and notifications

## Technical Requirements

    - Daily for 30 days
    - Weekly for 12 weeks
    - Monthly for 6 months
    
  Log_Data:
    - Daily for 7 days
    - Weekly for 4 weeks
```

## Implementation Notes

### Current Backup State Analysis
From project files:
- âœ… Basic backup scripts exist (`backup-system/` directory)
- âœ… PostgreSQL backup script available
- âœ… Docker backup capabilities present
- ðŸ”„ Need n8n workflow automation
- ðŸ”„ Need backup monitoring and alerting
- ðŸ”„ Need comprehensive backup verification

### Key Files to Create/Enhance

#### n8n Workflow Definitions
- `Database Backup Workflow` - Automated database dumps and validation
- `Configuration Backup Workflow` - System and application config backups  
- `Customer Data Backup Workflow` - Isolated customer data protection
- `Backup Monitoring Workflow` - Verification and alert generation

#### Application Integration
- `/agistaffers/components/dashboard/BackupManager.tsx` (enhance existing)
- `/agistaffers/app/api/backup/` - Backup management API endpoints
- `/agistaffers/lib/backup-service.ts` - Backup orchestration service
- Database schema for backup job tracking and status

### Required Components (shadcn/ui)
- `Card` for backup status displays
- `Progress` for backup operation progress
- `Badge` for backup job status indicators
- `Table` for backup history and logs
- `Alert` for backup failure notifications
- `Button` for manual backup triggers

### n8n Workflow Design

#### Database Backup Workflow
```yaml
Workflow_Steps:
  1. Pre_Backup_Health_Check:
     - Verify database connectivity
     - Check available storage space
     - Validate backup destination access
     
  2. Execute_Backup:
     - Create database dump with compression
     - Generate backup metadata and checksums
     - Store backup with timestamp naming
     
  3. Verify_Backup:
     - Test backup file integrity
     - Validate backup completeness
     - Store verification results
     
  4. Cleanup_And_Notify:
     - Remove expired backups per retention policy
     - Send success/failure notifications
     - Update monitoring dashboard
```

#### Configuration Backup Workflow
```yaml
Workflow_Steps:
  1. Configuration_Discovery:
     - Scan for docker-compose files
     - Identify configuration directories
     - Collect environment variables (sanitized)
     
  2. Create_Configuration_Archive:
     - Archive configuration files
     - Include version metadata
     - Encrypt sensitive configurations
     
  3. Store_And_Verify:
     - Store in backup location
     - Verify archive integrity
     - Update backup inventory
```

## Existing Tool Integration

### n8n Integration
- Create dedicated backup workflows in existing n8n instance
- Use n8n scheduling for backup timing and frequency
- Integrate with n8n notification systems for alerts

### Database Integration (PostgreSQL + pgAdmin)
- Use existing PostgreSQL instance for backup operations
- Leverage pgAdmin for backup job monitoring if needed
- Ensure backup operations don't impact production performance

### Monitoring Integration
- Add backup job metrics to existing Prometheus/Grafana stack
- Integrate backup status with existing dashboard
- Use existing alert notification channels

### Storage Integration
- Utilize existing storage infrastructure
- Consider MinIO integration for distributed backup storage
- Maintain backup encryption and security standards

## Data Protection Measures

### SteppersLife Data Priority
- **Highest Priority**: SteppersLife database gets most frequent backups
- **Verification Required**: Every SteppersLife backup must be integrity tested
- **Multiple Copies**: SteppersLife data backed up to multiple locations
- **Instant Alerts**: Any SteppersLife backup failure triggers immediate alerts

### Security Measures
- **Encrypted Backups**: All backups encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Backup access restricted to admin accounts only
- **Audit Logging**: All backup operations logged and monitored
- **Secure Storage**: Backup storage isolated from production systems

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Database backup and restoration testing (all databases)
- [ ] Configuration backup completeness verification
- [ ] Backup integrity validation testing
- [ ] n8n workflow execution testing under various conditions
- [ ] Backup failure scenario and alert testing
- [ ] Storage capacity and performance testing
- [ ] Cross-system backup compatibility testing

## Dependencies

- n8n workflow engine must be operational and accessible
- PostgreSQL databases must be accessible for backup operations
- Sufficient storage space must be available for backup retention
- Existing monitoring infrastructure must accommodate backup metrics

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] n8n workflows created and tested for all backup categories
- [ ] Backup monitoring dashboard integrated with admin interface
- [ ] Automated backup failure alerts working correctly
- [ ] Backup integrity verification automated and reliable
- [ ] SteppersLife data backup frequency and verification enhanced
- [ ] Code follows TypeScript strict mode and architectural standards
- [ ] Backup restoration procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Performance impact on production systems is minimal
- [ ] Security and encryption requirements fully implemented

## Notes

This story is critical for data protection and business continuity. The enhancement of existing backup systems with n8n automation and comprehensive monitoring aligns with enterprise requirements while prioritizing SteppersLife data protection as specified in project constraints.
