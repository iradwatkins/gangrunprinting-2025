## 🎨 UI FEATURES

### Three Login Options Available:
1. **Google OAuth** - Primary method (top button)
2. **Magic Link** - Email-based passwordless (default form)
3. **Email/Password** - Admin login (dropdown option)

### Visual Hierarchy:
- Google login is most prominent
- Magic link is default email form
- Password login is hidden behind dropdown (as requested)

## 🧪 TEST CREDENTIALS

### Admin Account:
- **Email:** `admin@agistaffers.com`
- **Password:** `admin123`
- **Role:** Super Admin
- **Access:** Full dashboard access

---

## 🔒 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

1. **Password Storage:** Using bcrypt with salt rounds
2. **Session Management:** JWT with 30-day expiry
3. **Role-Based Access:** Admin role verified on each request
4. **HTTPS Required:** In production, use SSL/TLS
5. **Rate Limiting:** Recommend adding in production

---

## 📝 NOTES

- The password option is intentionally less prominent (hidden in dropdown)
- This provides a fallback authentication method for admin users
- All three authentication methods work simultaneously
- Sessions are shared across all login methods
- The UI maintains consistent branding and styling

## 🚦 STATUS

✅ **READY FOR TESTING**

The email/password login is now fully implemented and integrated with the existing authentication system. Users can access it via the dropdown option on the main login page.
