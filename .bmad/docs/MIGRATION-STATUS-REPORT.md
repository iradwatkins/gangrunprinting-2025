# Migration Status Report - Gang Run Printing to Next.js 14+

**Date:** December 15, 2024  
**BMad Orchestrator:** Active  
**Current Phase:** Foundation Setup

## 🎯 Mission Critical

**Preserving the complex pricing system while migrating to Next.js 14+ standards**

## ✅ Completed (Story 2.1)

### 1. Next.js Project Initialized
- **Location:** `/nextjs` subfolder
- **Version:** Next.js 15.4.6 with App Router
- **Configuration:** TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind CSS
- **Output:** Standalone for self-hosting

### 2. Critical Pricing Engine Preserved
```
shared/pricing/
├── calculations.ts         # Advanced broker pricing (PRESERVED)
├── discounts.ts           # Discount logic (PRESERVED)
└── documentation-calculations.ts # 5-step formula (PRESERVED)
```

### 3. Dependencies Installed
- Supabase client
- Prisma ORM
- React Query
- Framer Motion
- Zod & React Hook Form

### 4. Architecture Documented
- Full migration plan in Epic 2
- Critical preservation requirements documented
- Technical architecture designed

## 🔄 In Progress (Story 2.2)

### Shared Utilities Architecture
Creating the bridge between Vite and Next.js apps:
- Shared pricing module
- Database abstraction layer
- Type definitions

## 📋 Upcoming Stories

### Story 2.3: Database Abstraction
- Repository pattern for data access
- Supabase → Prisma migration path
- Maintain backwards compatibility

### Story 2.4: Homepage Migration
- First Server Component implementation
- SSR for better performance
- Preserve all animations

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Blue-Green Approach
- **Blue (Current):** Vite app on port 3100
- **Green (New):** Next.js app on port 3101
- **Nginx:** Routes traffic based on migration progress

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### Pricing System Protection
1. **No modifications** to pricing logic
2. **Extensive testing** before each phase
3. **Snapshot testing** for price calculations
4. **Rollback plan** if discrepancies found

### Business Continuity
- Vite app continues running
- Gradual migration by route
- Feature flags for testing
- Database remains unchanged

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Goals
- [ ] 50% faster homepage load (SSR)
- [ ] 30% smaller JavaScript bundle
- [ ] Improved Core Web Vitals
- [ ] 100% pricing accuracy maintained

### Business Goals
- [ ] Zero downtime during migration
- [ ] No customer-facing errors
- [ ] Maintained conversion rates
- [ ] Preserved all functionality

## 🔍 Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests:** Pricing calculations
2. **Integration Tests:** API compatibility
3. **E2E Tests:** Critical user journeys
4. **Performance Tests:** Load times
5. **Regression Tests:** Feature parity
