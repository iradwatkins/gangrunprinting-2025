# Project Brief: AGI Staffers + SteppersLife Enhancement Project

## Executive Summary

**AGI Staffers** is transforming into an enterprise-grade hosting platform while simultaneously modernizing **SteppersLife** into a cutting-edge event management platform with AI capabilities. This dual-platform enhancement leverages existing server infrastructure (pgAdmin, portainer, n8n, flowise, chat, searxng) to create two competitive, enterprise-ready platforms.

**Primary Problem**: AGI Staffers lacks enterprise features needed for customer acquisition, while SteppersLife runs on outdated Supabase infrastructure with valuable data requiring careful preservation and modernization.

**Target Market**: Enterprise customers seeking hosting solutions (AGI Staffers) and event organizers requiring modern event management platforms (SteppersLife).

**Key Value Proposition**: Transform two platforms simultaneously while protecting critical SteppersLife data, achieving 70% storage efficiency through intelligent tool integration, and establishing competitive enterprise capabilities with comprehensive AI automation.
