- **"Ira, as CLIENT..."** = Login with client@test.com
- **"Ira, as CUSTOMER..."** = Browse without login

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S SET UP

- **ADMIN account:** Has full platform access
- **CLIENT account:** Has 3 test websites:
  - Tech Startup Landing
  - Acme Store
  - Small Business Site
- **Both use:** Same password (admin123)
