## üö® **CRITICAL PROJECT CONTEXT**

### **Mission:**
Execute systematic enhancement of AGI Staffers (hosting platform) + SteppersLife (event platform) while protecting valuable SteppersLife data using BMAD methodology.

### **Non-Negotiable Constraints (All Agent Personas):**
1. **PROTECT STEPPERSLIFE DATA AT ALL COSTS** - Zero data loss tolerance
2. **USE EXISTING TOOLS INTELLIGENTLY** - Enhance pgAdmin, portainer, n8n, flowise, chat, searxng (don't duplicate)
3. **STORAGE EFFICIENCY MANDATE** - Maximum 2GB additional storage
4. **TECHNOLOGY STACK COMPLIANCE** - Next.js 14 + TypeScript + shadcn/ui exclusive
5. **BMAD STORY-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT** - Every action must have corresponding story

### **Existing Server Infrastructure (All Agents Must Integrate):**
- ‚úÖ pgAdmin (database management) - USE, don't install new
- ‚úÖ portainer (container management) - INTEGRATE with
- ‚úÖ n8n (workflow automation) - ENHANCE existing workflows
- ‚úÖ flowise (AI workflow builder) - LEVERAGE for AI features
- ‚úÖ chat (AI interface) - BUILD UPON for support features
- ‚úÖ searxng (privacy search) - UTILIZE for search capabilities

## üéØ **BMAD AGENT EXECUTION PROTOCOL**

1. **Read `CLAUDE-CODE-INSTRUCTIONS.md` completely**
2. **Understand all agent role responsibilities**
3. **Confirm understanding of data protection protocols**
4. **Review current project phase and story status**

### **Step 2: AGENT PERSONA SELECTION**
**Ask me which agent persona you should assume:**
- üéØ **"Should I act as Orchestrator Agent?"** (project coordination)
- üìã **"Should I act as Scrum Master Agent?"** (story management)
- üíª **"Should I act as Dev Agent?"** (implementation)
- ‚úÖ **"Should I act as QA Agent?"** (validation)

### **Step 3: AGENT-SPECIFIC EXECUTION**
**Once persona is confirmed, follow agent-specific protocols from `CLAUDE-CODE-INSTRUCTIONS.md`**

## ‚ö° **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

**Your first response should confirm:**

1. ‚úÖ "I have read and internalized CLAUDE-CODE-INSTRUCTIONS.md"
2. ‚úÖ "I understand I will assume different BMAD agent personas as needed"
3. ‚úÖ "I understand the SteppersLife data protection requirements"
4. ‚úÖ "I understand the existing tool integration approach"
5. ‚úÖ "I will follow story-driven development methodology exactly"
6. ‚úÖ "I will use Next.js 14 + TypeScript + shadcn/ui exclusively"

**Then ask:**
- **"Which BMAD agent persona should I assume first?"**
  - Orchestrator (project planning)
  - Scrum Master (story creation)

- Proceed if data integrity is at risk
- Switch agent personas without confirmation

**ALWAYS:**
- Reference `CLAUDE-CODE-INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed agent guidance
- Follow story-driven development workflow
- Document all decisions and agent actions
- Validate data integrity before proceeding
- Use existing tools intelligently
- Maintain agent persona consistency during task completion

**Project completion means:**
- ‚úÖ **SteppersLife**: 100% data preserved + modern Next.js 14 platform + AI features
- ‚úÖ **AGI Staffers**: Enterprise hosting platform ready for customers  
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure**: Comprehensive monitoring + automation + scalability
- ‚úÖ **Integration**: All existing tools enhanced and leveraged optimally
- ‚úÖ **BMAD Compliance**: Complete story-driven development with documentation
