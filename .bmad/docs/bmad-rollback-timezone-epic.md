# BMAD Epic: Emergency Rollback & Chicago Timezone Implementation

**Epic ID**: BMAD-001
**Created**: August 11, 2025
**Status**: In Progress
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours

## Epic Overview

Implementing enterprise-grade rollback capabilities and system-wide Chicago timezone conversion while preparing infrastructure for shadcn/ui admin dashboard rebuild.

## BMAD Method Application

### BENCHMARK Phase
- **Current State**: UTC timezone, no automated rollback, files scattered in download/
- **Target State**: Chicago timezone, <2min rollback capability, organized .bmad structure
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Rollback time: <2 minutes
  - Zero data loss during rollback
  - All timestamps in Chicago timezone
  - 100% critical file preservation

### MODEL Phase
- **Architecture Model**: Blue-green deployment with automated health checks
- **Rollback Model**: Snapshot-based with automatic triggers
- **Timezone Model**: System-wide Chicago time implementation
- **File Organization Model**: Hierarchical .bmad structure

### ANALYZE Phase
- **Risk Analysis**: Minimal with proper snapshots and blue-green deployment
- **Impact Analysis**: 4-hour implementation, zero downtime
- **Dependency Analysis**: All services require timezone update
- **Performance Analysis**: Rollback <2min, health checks every 30s

### DELIVER Phase
- **Deliverable 1**: Emergency rollback infrastructure
- **Deliverable 2**: Chicago timezone across all systems
- **Deliverable 3**: Organized .bmad documentation
- **Deliverable 4**: Prepared infrastructure for UI rebuild

## User Stories

### Story 1: Emergency Rollback Capability
**As a** system administrator
**I want** to rollback any deployment within 2 minutes
**So that** I can quickly recover from any issues

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Rollback completes in <2 minutes
- [ ] Zero data loss during rollback
- [ ] Automated health monitoring triggers rollback
- [ ] Blue-green deployment switching works

### Story 2: Chicago Timezone Implementation
**As a** Chicago-based user
**I want** all system times in Chicago timezone
**So that** I can work with familiar local times

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] VPS system time shows Chicago timezone
- [ ] All containers use Chicago time
- [ ] Database timestamps in Chicago time
- [ ] Admin dashboard displays Chicago time
- [ ] Backup schedules use Chicago time

### Story 3: File Organization Migration
**As a** developer
**I want** organized .bmad documentation structure
**So that** I can easily find and manage project files

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All critical files moved to .bmad/
- [ ] MCP configuration preserved
- [ ] Architecture docs accessible
- [ ] Download folder ready for deletion

### Story 4: UI Rebuild Preparation
**As a** frontend developer
**I want** infrastructure ready for shadcn/ui rebuild
**So that** I can implement modern admin dashboard

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Current JS dashboard backed up
- [ ] Blue-green deployment ready
- [ ] MCP servers configured
- [ ] TypeScript infrastructure prepared

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Emergency Rollback Infrastructure (1 hour)
1. Create rollback directory structure
2. Implement snapshot scripts
3. Set up blue-green containers
4. Configure nginx load balancer
5. Enable database WAL backups

### Phase 2: Chicago Timezone (1 hour)
1. Update VPS system timezone
2. Configure container timezones
3. Update PostgreSQL timezone
4. Modify application configurations
5. Update backup schedules

### Phase 3: File Migration (1 hour)
1. Analyze download folder contents
2. Create .bmad directory structure
3. Migrate critical files
4. Preserve MCP configurations
5. Document file locations

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification (1 hour)
1. Test rollback procedures
2. Verify timezone changes
3. Validate file migrations
4. Check health monitoring
5. Prepare UI rebuild checklist

## Dependencies
- SSH access to VPS
- Docker and docker-compose
- PostgreSQL with WAL enabled
- Nginx for load balancing
- Current admin dashboard backup

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Service disruption during timezone change
  **Mitigation**: Use blue-green deployment for zero downtime
- **Risk**: File loss during migration
  **Mitigation**: Create full backup before migration
- **Risk**: Rollback failure
  **Mitigation**: Test rollback procedures before production

## Success Metrics
- Rollback capability: <2 minutes recovery time
- Timezone accuracy: 100% Chicago time across all systems
- File preservation: 100% critical files migrated
- System stability: Zero downtime during implementation
- Monitoring coverage: All services health-checked

## Next Steps After Completion
1. Begin shadcn/ui admin dashboard rebuild
2. Implement comprehensive update management page
3. Enhance monitoring with predictive analytics
4. Add multi-tenant rollback capabilities
5. Create automated testing suite
