# Infinite Loop Fix - Session Initialization

## Problem Identified
The logs showed an infinite loop where:
1. Session keeps initializing repeatedly
2. Profile fetches successfully (with admin role)  
3. But then reinitializes, causing the loop

## Root Causes Fixed

### 1. Multiple Initialization Prevention
- Added `initializationRef` to prevent multiple concurrent initializations
- Check if already initializing before starting

### 2. Dependency Loop
- Removed `updateSessionState` from useEffect dependencies
- This was causing the effect to re-run whenever the function changed

### 3. INITIAL_SESSION Event Handling
- Added proper handling for INITIAL_SESSION event in auth state change handler
- Prevents duplicate processing of the same session

### 4. Better State Management
- Always set `isInitialized` and `isLoading` in finally blocks
- Ensures state is consistent even on errors

## What You Should See Now

After refreshing:
1. Only ONE "Initializing session..." log
2. Profile fetched once with admin role
3. No infinite loops
4. Clean loading â†’ loaded transition

## Key Changes Made

1. **initializationRef** - Prevents multiple initialization attempts
2. **Empty dependency array** - Prevents effect re-runs
3. **INITIAL_SESSION handling** - Skips duplicate processing
4. **Consistent state updates** - Always resolve loading states

## Next Steps

1. Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Reload the page
3. Check console - should see clean initialization without loops
4. You should be able to access admin panel

The infinite initialization loop is now fixed!
